# 1st Full Stack Developer bootcamp project

The purpose of this project is to get us integrated with Git/GitHub.
This is also our very first project within devCodeCamp that is graded.

## Requirements

You should ensure that you have Chrome dev tools or Firefox to run the code in the browser. 

## Usage

I'm using vscode plugin live server to see the actual project
Navigate to index.html and find the go live button on the bottom left of vscode

Towards the top of the screen you will see what your generated day trip is. 
Press the yes button if you are satisfied with the generated trip
Press the no button if you are not satisfied and want the trip to be regenerated.
